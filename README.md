### Technologies Used
This was the first time I have used the **Google maps platform**.  This web-app utilises the **maps**, **places** and **goecode** libraries.  Also the **autocomplete** api from the places library for text input.  

This is also my first time using:
* **Webpack** and modular javascript
* **Lodash** for array manipulation
